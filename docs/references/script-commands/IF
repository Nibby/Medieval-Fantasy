        </if>


        $DATA_CHECKED           - The value of the data being checked.
                                    If check data value is a ScriptData
                                        check="$SCRIPT_DATA" scriptDataParam="Script_Data_Key" ...
                                    If check data value is a position
                                        check="$PLAYER_POSITION" ...


        $LOGIC_OPERATION        - Operation to compare.
                                    ==  - Numerical equals
                                    >=  - Grater than or equal to
                                    <=  - Less than or equal to
                                    >   - Greater than
                                    <   - Less than
                                    equals - String value comparison (same as .equals())

        $COMPARE_VALUE          - Value being compared, referral flags are allowed here also


    NOTE: If statements can be nested. Careful when checking same variables:
    e.g.
        <if check="$SCRIPT_DATA" scriptDataParam="var" operation="==" compare="0">
            ... other command
            <scriptType key="var" value="1" />
        </if>

        <if check="$SCRIPT_DATA" scriptDataParam="var" operation="==" compare="1">
            ... commands
        </if>

    This will cause both statements to be executed, since second block will be executed
        at the end of the first block. To avoid this problem, place the blocks where checked
        values won't be altered above ones that will alter check values.
