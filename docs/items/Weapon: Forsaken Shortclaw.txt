Forsaken Shortclaw is a quest weapon, obtained by finding Johnathan Luca and completing his weapon crafting quest.

    "A sinister, sharp dagger mounted on a highly decorated magical hilt in the form of an eagle's claw.
    The dark blade pulsates with an uncomfortable aura. It is said that those who dare to wield this sword are destined to
    bring bad luck."

Legend says that the land of Saya had a pair of legendary daggers: Forsaken Claw and Ravenous Claw, crafted by a legendary
weapon-smith using both claws from a giant magical eagle 'Delacroix'. Those who are able to wield both are granted enormous power.

Not so much of a newly crafted weapon, it used to be known as the dreaded 'Forsaken Claw' obtained by Luca after killing a
famous Elysian warlord. It was used by Luca during his earlier life as a notorious assassin.

After the battle between Luca ('S') and Yao ('Z'), Yao's dark-magic infused Ravenous Claw shattered Luca's dagger, only a tiny
portion of the blade still remained afterwards. The new crafting ingredients player brought to Luca broke down the remaining
blade body and turned into a weaker, but still very strong material.

Although the blade is no longer legendary, users should be freed from the 'bad luck curse', right?
