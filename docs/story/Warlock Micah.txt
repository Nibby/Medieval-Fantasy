Micah is a highly acclaimed wizard in Elysian times, regarded highly for his destructive magic in war times, he is one to be feared
even by his own army. His superior tactics helped Elysian forces capture countless other kingdoms, uniting the Saya continent.
He was given the honorable title of Grand Warlock and was regarded as the pinnacle of magic mastery.

His powers threaten many groups outside and inside the kingdom and even seen as a threat by King Arthus himself.
Assassination attempts were frequent, but only one succeeded after an exhausting long battle between the current leader of The Twilight
Order ('Z'). Exhausted and elated, Micah collapsed in front of his ex-student who, despite his warnings, was consumed by the thirst of
learning the dark arts.

His grimoires and possessions were stolen, a soulbound curse was placed upon his possessions.
It was said that those who wielded his weapon and wore his robe would be granted immense magical power at the sacrifice of eternal
torment.
