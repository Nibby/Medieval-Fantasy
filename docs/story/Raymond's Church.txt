continent. The Holy Sanctum is the heart of the church body, said to be protected by the 8 Heavenly Hosts. It is known as a
place of love, belonging and salvation. It's holy grounds are kept pure, free from the evil that devours the continent.

    The angelic item set are items of great arcane power harnessing the power of the souls of mankind.
    Like how a philosophers stone is crafted, the angelic items draws power from countless sacrificed human souls
    crystalized in the form of a stunning aqua jewel, metal or other form of ornament.

    These gods reside in the Eerie Void in the form of mutant monsters. Upon entering the supposed 'godly realms',
    the light created by the dimension portal cause pain in the God's (as they are stimulated by white light), and
    sharp screams echoes through the corridors. The gods reside in pits, and is truly a horrific view.

    Raymond was not a holy saint, but a communicator of one of these gods. He himself had not witnessed the true form of these gods.
    The gods are not officially honored, it is but a fake simulacrum fabricated by Raymond. Although he is a man with good intentions,
    he stained his hands in the will of doing so and ultimately brainwashed his believers using the magic of the angelic item set.

    Raymond also created the angelic item set, sacrificing an entire large city of people, scripture describes it as 'the city was elevated into
    the godly realms'.
