A notorious assassin on the outskirts of Elysia. Infamous for his brutal methods of assassination, he was often hired by cults and
rebellious groups to assassinate kingdom officials, be it local or state members. Operated under the codename 'S', he was secretly
granted membership in Naya's most secretive assassin organization years later. Unsatisfied with 'Z's leadership of the group,
his attempt to duel 'Z' ended in a stalemate.

With his true identity revealed during the duel, he later abandoned his membership in the group and isolated himself from the Naya
forces. After barely escaping 4 assassination attempts, he tasted fear for the firs time.

Perhaps mentally scarred, he decided to remain anonymous in Glysia as a disguised weapon-smith under the name 'Ethan'.
