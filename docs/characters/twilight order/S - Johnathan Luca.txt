Once a young, notorious assassin on the outskirts of Elysia. Infamous for his brutal methods of assassination, he was often hired by
cults and rebellious groups to assassinate kingdom officials, be it local or state members. Operated under the name 'Jasper', he was
secretly granted membership in Naya's most secretive assassin organization years later by 'Z'.
Shocked by the ruthlessness of the assassins in the group and 'Z's reckless leadership he went on to discover the true identity of 'Z'
(Yao Morgan). In one silent night, he broke into 'Z's chambers and attempted an assassination.

After an unexpectedly long fight, it ended in a stalemate.

With his true identity revealed during the duel, he later abandoned his membership in the group and isolated himself from the Nayan
forces. 'Z', quick to find replacement assassins, sent replacement 'candidates' for The Order to assassinate Luca. After 4 failed
assassinations, Luca killed the first three but let  the last (codenamed 'V', Xander Crane) live and report the fake news that Luca
 was dead (since Luca knew his older brother, 'B', Ark Crane who secretly died in the hands of 'Z' for questioning his orders).

Upon entering Glysia, the devastating impact of the war was clearly visible. Rubbles and ashes scattered on every city he travelled to.
Families without a father, households damaged beyond repair and the diseased piled around the streets. After some conversation with
a few of the townspeople who were willing and able to talk, he learned the consequences of his actions on the cities of Glysia.

Horrified, he questioned his motives and his past. For the first time, his empathy returned to him and he is now a well hidden
weapon-smith operating under the name of 'Ethan' in a remote village near the outskirts of Glysia to avoid 'Z's grasp.
