Unlike most of the members of The Twilight Order, who are invited to the order through their vicious deeds, Crane was a
young genius tactician and skilled fighter in the disbanded Elysian knight division, who later was put into The Twilight Order
under the intention of aiding Kris with the strategies of the group. Alas, he was a man who was never recognized for the
true talent that he had. The plans Crane suggested were mostly dismissed by Kris, as Crane's plans are dangerous and risky,
but could yield great results.

When Kris was executed after the defeat of Nayan army in the first war, Crane was a potential candidate for the leader of
The Order. However, the death of Micah in Yao's ('Z') hands secured Yao the position of leader in the order.
Crane's fighting style is much different than that of Yao's, and much less reckless.

A year later, Yao overheard from various sources of rumours that Ark's younger brother, Xander, knew the identity
of Ark and even knows some classified information of The Order. To that, Yao ordered the death of Xander to 'X' (Nightshade Crowe).
The assassination was ultimately unsuccessful as Ark discovered 'Z's orders and retaliated at 'X'. With Xander at Ark's side,
'X' was forced to retreat.

Realizing that Ark grasped the communication channel of The Twilight Order, 'Z' changed the functioning hierarchy of The Order
and set out to kill Ark himself.

With a cunning plan, 'Z' acted swiftly. Overwhelmed by 'Z's powers, Ark knew that death was inevitable.
Instead, he sacrificed his life to protect his much younger brother, Xander Crane. That dreadful night saw the death of almost
the entire of the Crane household, with the exception that Xander fled to the outlands of the continent.
