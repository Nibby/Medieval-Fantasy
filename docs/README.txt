Think about this section as a creative corner of the game.
I know how stressful it can be to make something work.

BUT...

When you come here, just relax and think only on the game world.
The fine aspects of it.

Imagine the game engine is done, and all the framework is there.
Imagine all there is left is game content.

Imagine you're in the world,
what sort of things would you see?

Describe them!
All ideas are accepted.
Feel free to make your own section too!
