                Changes made while you were gone:;;

                - A* path finding movement was made;
                  for players and other actors.;
                - Multi-page dialogue boxes.;
                - On-screen hint messages.;
                - More NPC script commands;
                - Interacting with NPCs now remove;
                  the cursor animation.;
                - Resolved critical scripting issue;
                - Added on-screen hints!;
            </content>
            <content>
                A few things on my mind:;;

                - NPC scripted movement;
                - Logic 'if' statements in script;
                - The ability to read a sign;
                - Doors, many ways we can do this;
                - More generic scripting system for;
                  event scripting.;
                - New tile assets, what we have is;
                  no way near enough.;
                - Monsters + combat! Fun fun.
            </content>
            <content>
                Goals in the the grand scheme...;;

                - Scripting System;
                - Important objects (doors, signs);
                - Sound effect + BGM system;
                - Map lighting;
                - Inventory + items;
                - Monsters;
                - Magic, spells &amp; combat;;

                - Make the content! :D;

                Game is coming along very nicely.;;
                To be honest the reason I seem like;
                I know my 2D is because ... I've ;
                started similar projects countless;
                times. I was never able to follow;
                through with them after a while;;

                Thank you for the motivation so far;
                you may not notice it, but I can;
                definitely tell!
